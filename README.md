# Genboost
This is the code I used in an experiment for a presentaion on Generalization Boosts.

The dataset for the experiment was "Obesity Levels" ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels )

In CodeSAM.py I implemented the Sharpness-Aware Minimization Optimizer.
This optimizer is based on the paper "Sharpness-aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization" (https://openreview.net/forum?id=6Tm1mposlrM),
but was implemented by using David Samuels (https://github.com/davda54) github repo (https://github.com/davda54/sam).
